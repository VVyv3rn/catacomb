# Catacomb
WIP of a rogue like dungeon crawler coded in Java. There is not much to do in the game as its still in a very early state.

## Purpose<br/> 
This is meant to be a start for me getting into game development and I wanted to make a combat based game<br/> 
currently theres only:<br/> 
-basic combat<br/> 
-leveling<br/> 
-enemies to kill<br/> 
-a buggy inventory<br/> 
-buggy spawn mechanics<br/> 

## How to run
- In order to run this program you will need to have Java installed<br/> 
- Download the catacomb.zip file<br/> 
- Extract the catacomb.zip file<br/> 
- Open it through a Java IDE, preferably [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) <br/>
**DO NOT TOUCH THE CODE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. THERE IS ALSO VERY FEW COMMENTS SO GOOD LUCK UNDERSTANDING** <br/> 
- Visual Studio Code will likely ask you to download the Java features, you will need to do this in order to run the program.<br/> 
- At the top click run, or F5 will work too. If theres a popup in the bottom right asking you to fix something click fix and it will show something in the top middle of the screen at the search bar and click main.Main

## Controls
- Pause Menu: Escape
- Character Stats: C
- Move: WASD
- Attack: Left Click
- Open Inventory: I
- Continue Dialogue: E
- Open Debug Menu: T
- Reload/Load Map: R

## Extra Notes
Due to the buggy inventory and spawn mechanics will often cause the program to run into an error so you will have to restart the game. There is currently no saving mechanic.
